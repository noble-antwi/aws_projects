# End-to-End AWS Web Application Deployment with Load Balancing, S3, and Auto Scaling

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of deploying a scalable web application on **AWS** using various services such as **EC2**, **Load Balancer**, **S3**, and **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**. The project walks through each stage of implementation, from setting up the basic infrastructure to scaling the web application for high availability and reliability. The goal is to create an efficient and scalable web service with minimal downtime and optimal performance.

## Architectural Diagram

The architecture of the project follows a scalable, fault-tolerant model with the following components:

1. **Amazon EC2**: Hosts the web server for the application.
2. **Amazon ALB**: Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple EC2 instances for better load balancing.
3. **Amazon S3**: Provides storage for files accessible via the web application.
4. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demand.
5. **NAT Gateway:** Facilitates outbound internet access for instances in private subnets, while maintaining security.
6. **Security Groups:** Controls inbound and outbound traffic to instances, ensuring that only authorized traffic can reach the EC2 instances and load balancer.

## Steps to Accomplish the Project

### 1. **Launch EC2 Instance**

- **Goal:** Provision an EC2 instance to serve as the web server for the application.
  - **Process:** We created and launched an EC2 instance within a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), configured with the necessary security settings to allow web traffic.

### 2. **Setup Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

- **Goal:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances for better load handling.
   - **Process:** We set up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to route incoming HTTP traffic to the EC2 instance. A **target group** was created to specify the instances receiving traffic, ensuring high availability.

### 3. **Deploy Web Application**

   - **Goal:** Host a simple web application accessible through the internet.
   - **Process:** After configuring the load balancer, we tested the web application’s accessibility through the ALB’s public DNS name. The application was set up on the EC2 instance and accessed by clients via a browser.

### 4. **Implement Amazon S3 for File Storage**

   - **Goal:** Provide scalable storage for files, accessible from the web application.
   - **Process:** An **Amazon S3 bucket** was created to store and manage files, making them available for download or other actions directly from the web application.

### 5. **Set up Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

   - **Goal:** Automate scaling to handle varying loads, ensuring the application remains available during traffic spikes.
   - **Process:** An **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** was set up to automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on traffic demand. This eliminates single points of failure and enhances the application’s reliability and performance.

### 6. **Testing and Verification**

   - **Goal:** Verify the entire infrastructure and its components function correctly.
   - **Process:** Several testing steps were carried out to ensure that the Auto Scaling policies were functioning, the web application was scalable, and traffic was distributed appropriately across the instances. Load tests were simulated, and scaling behavior was monitored.

## Project Benefits

- **Scalability**: The Auto Scaling Group ensures that the web application can scale dynamically based on demand, ensuring optimal performance even during traffic spikes.
- **Reliability**: The integration of the Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group enhances the availability and fault tolerance of the application, eliminating single points of failure.
- **Cost Efficiency**: By utilizing Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2 Spot instances (if needed), the infrastructure automatically adjusts to traffic, ensuring you only pay for what you use.
- **Security**: With proper configuration of Security Groups, Load Balancers, and encrypted communication, the application ensures secure traffic flow and data storage.
- **Performance Optimization**: The integration of Amazon S3 allows for fast and scalable file storage and delivery, improving user experience and performance.
