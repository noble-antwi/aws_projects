# **Envelope Encryption with AWS KMS**  

This project demonstrates how to implement **Envelope Encryption** using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**. The guide walks through the entire process, including **generating, encrypting, decrypting, and securely managing data keys** to ensure strong encryption practices.  

## **Project Overview**  

- **Generate a Data Key** using AWS KMS  
- **Encrypt and store** the Data Key securely  
- **Decrypt the Data Key** when needed  
- **Use the Data Key** to locally encrypt and decrypt data  
- **Cleanup** resources by deleting the KMS key and alias  

## **Prerequisites**  

Before running the commands, ensure you have:  
âœ… **AWS CLI** installed and configured  
âœ… **OpenSSL** installed for local encryption and decryption  
âœ… **An active AWS KMS key** to perform encryption tasks
